        <p> <mark>What is Machine Learning?</mark></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Machine learning helps computers learn like humans, but more efficiently.</li>
            <li>As machines go through the process of learning by processing data and looking for patterns,
            it can then make decisions and predictions based on what was learned and continue to adapt and refine its models as more and more data is used. </li>
          </ul>

        <p><mark>Influences of Machine Learning</mark></p>
          <ul>
          <li>Machines have the ability to process lots of data at a time.</li>
          <li>This makes them super efficient and provides a higher potential for accuracy.</li>
          <li>Machines can process data with more accuracy and can be trained to filter out data to narrow results down</li>
          <li>When there is more accuracy, we get better results</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
            Medicine: For example: using data from a variety of symptoms and the diagnosis for those range of symptoms, can make the diagnosis process more accurate and make sure we are as healthy as we can be.
          </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><mark>Components of Machine Learning</mark></p>
        <p><mark>Representation</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Various machine learning models can be used to represent data by finding patterns</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Bayesian networks</li>
        <li>Neural networks</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
        <p><mark>Evaluation</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>With so many different types of models, evaluation is used to determine which model works best for the data</li>
        </ul>
        <p><mark>Optimization</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Since there are many ways to configure a model, there are several ways to optimize the model.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><mark>Types of Machine Learning</mark></p>
        <p><mark>Supervised Learning</mark></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data is labeled. Less work for machines but more work for humans especially when dealing with lots of data.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Labels: data that is described to the machine</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Looking for a specific output</li>
          <li>Also known as inductive learning</li>
        </ul>

        <p><mark>Unsupervised Learning</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Data is not labeled. Machines look for patterns with clustering without supervision</li>
        <li>Output is not necessarily what you want and can be completely random</li>
        </ul>

        <p><mark>Semi-Supervised Learning</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning</li>
        <li>Combines the unsupervised aspect of clustering unlabeled data and supervised learning by accurately labeling some of the unlabeled dataset. Then, the labeled data is used to label the rest of the unlabeled data.</li>
        <li>Great for large datasets such as webpages, videos, and audio files</li>
        </ul>

        <p><mark>Reinforcement Learning</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Repetitive teaching</li>
        <li>Kind of like giving the machines a test as the machine learns from feedback when it provides an incorrect answer.</li>
        <li>Let’s say there’s a situation in which the machine has to guess what kind of music category is being played. If classical piano music is playing, but the machine says it’s “pop”, then the machine will be told it’s wrong. If it guesses “classical”, then the machine will be told that it’s right. The more data the machine is shown, the more the machine will know about the music category.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><mark>Challenges of Machine Learning</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Lots of data is needed to start training a machine to understand your data.</li>
        <li>Need to ensure that you have a good set of data to get the results you want.</li>
        <li>Feature Engineering: cleaning up data to contain the features you want and getting rid of the features you don’t want</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Feature selection: selecting features from data that you want to focus on</li>
          <li>Feature extraction: using the features you collected already and continuing to modify it</li>
          <li>Feature creation: when you get new data, you create new features</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><mark>Before starting your own machine learning project</mark></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Determine your objective. Set the intention</li>
        <li>Gather as much information as possible from as many sources as possible.</li>
        <li>Data Collection - data wrangling, cleaning, pre-processing</li>
        <li>Machine learning models</li>
        <li>Keep restarting this process until you fulfill your objective</li>
        </ul>
